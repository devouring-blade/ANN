# implement an ANN using numerical differentiation and gradient descent
## numerical differentiation and gradient descent
we compute the gradient of the loss function with respect to each parameter via numerical differentiation. and then we use gradient descent to update all parameters

## single - layered Perceptron
create an single - layered ANN model and perform binary classification using numerical differentiation and gradient descent.
To calculate the gradient accurately, you must use automatic differentiation. However, here we use numerical differentiation to approximate the gradient.
Gradient descent with automatic differentiation will be discussed in detail in the Backpropagation part.
